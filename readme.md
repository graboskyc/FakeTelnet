# This demo consists of:
  * Python scripts - Create a linux box with three users (su/wwp, cisco/cisco, juniper/juniper0), put all scripts in /opt/faketelnet, then edit /etc/passwd to have the user's shell be the corresponding .py file, not bash
  * Environment Package - Import to a server and set IP's to that of the above linux machine
  * TestShell Test - Connect to reservation created from above env pkg and then it will run demo telnet commands

# In use
  * Created by Chris.g (chris.g@quali.com) and powering the QualiX/Guacamole demo on CloudShell Live
